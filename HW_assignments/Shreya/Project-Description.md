## Project Topic Area

An individual senior design project to build a constraint-based TA scheduling optimization tool.
The tool uses Python and Google OR-Tools' CP-SAT solver to automatically assign TAs to course
sections based on:
- TA availability and class schedules  
- section and professor preferences  
- skills (Python, CAD, Excel, etc.)  
- diversity and experience balance per section  
- conflict and eligibility flags  

The goal is to replace the current 50+ hour manual scheduling process with an automated,
reproducible system that generates fair, optimized TA assignments in minutes.
