## Project Sought

I am pursuing an individual capstone project to fully build and deploy the TA Scheduling Optimization Tool as a scalable system. Future goals include UI development, multiple schedule ranking, and fully automated availability extraction. The project is to develop a customized constraint-based scheduling tool to automate the assignment of teaching assistants (TAs) to course sections, a project that was equal parts technical challenge and organizational analysis. This project details the context of the problem, the technical solutions I engineered, the iterative development process, and the significant insights gained from applying theoretical knowledge to a critical real-world operational need.
