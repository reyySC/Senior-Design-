# Professional Biography

I am a senior engineering student majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Economics. I have gained experience developing data-driven automation tools for academic operations. Most recently, I designed a constraint-based TA Scheduling Optimization Tool for the University of Cincinnati, where I automated schedule data collection and created an optimization system using Google OR-Tools CP-SAT Solver. The tool improves assignment fairness, balances skill sets, and reduces manual scheduling effort.

**TA Scheduling Optimization Developer – UC Engineering** (Summer 2025)  
- Built an optimization model using Google OR-Tools CP-SAT.  
- Automated PDF schedule parsing using Python (`pdfplumber`, regex).  
- Reduced scheduling time from 50+ hours to automated execution.

## Project Sought

I am pursuing an individual capstone project to fully build and deploy the TA Scheduling Optimization Tool as a scalable system. Future goals include UI development, multiple schedule ranking, and fully automated availability extraction. The project is to develop a customized constraint-based scheduling tool to automate the assignment of teaching assistants (TAs) to course sections, a project that was equal parts technical challenge and organizational analysis. This project details the context of the problem, the technical solutions I engineered, the iterative development process, and the significant insights gained from applying theoretical knowledge to a critical real-world operational need.
